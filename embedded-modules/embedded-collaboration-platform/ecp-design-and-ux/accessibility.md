# Accessibility

The Symphony ECP has been designed and developed to comply with most [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) guidelines. The product will continue to follow these guidelines as it evolves.

### Keyboard navigation

{% hint style="info" %}
Access to the Symphony Admin Portal is needed to be able to configure keyboard navigation.
{% endhint %}

The Symphony ECP is designed to provide standard keyboard navigation using keys such as TAB, SPACE, ENTER, HOME, END and directional arrows.

It also allows the configuration of keys or combinations of keys that provide an alternative way to do something that youâ€™d typically do with a mouse. These combinations are mostly designed to work with a MOD key depending on the operating system. In case they create a conflict with the environment in which the ECP is installed, or you want to change, their configuration is available in the admin portal.

In addition to the most common operating system keyboard shortcuts, those specific to the Symphony ECP include:

# Error messages

Platform integrations become a joint responsibility between companies to advise and guide users when technical glitches occur or something does not work as expected. The ECP will trigger errors when API calls are made, but it's up to the integrator to identify where these errors appear and what their message means. Ensure users are advised of any steps to be taken in order to solve the issue or contact the correct support team.

When something goes wrong, it's important to display an error message that is clear and easy to understand. By following user experience best practices your users will have a positive experience when encountering an error. In particular make sure that your error message is explicit about the fact that something has gone wrong, use a human-readable language without jargon and phrase your error messages politely.

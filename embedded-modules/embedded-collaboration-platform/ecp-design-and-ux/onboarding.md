# Onboarding

### First time user experience

New users need to become familiar with the Symphony ECP user interface and quickly learn how to take advantage of the different capabilities when it is presented for the first time. For this reason we suggest introducing the ECP as soon as it is activated.

### Introducing ECP as new feature

* If your app allows in-product new feature announcements please consider to display help windows highlighting some key use cases that appear when users first encounter the Symphony ECP.
* Alternative to in-product announcements, marketing communications can be sent to users and training material can be updated.
* Use technical documentation providing guidance to IT and support teams of new integration and dependencies.

### Theming

ECP offers out of the box two native theming color palettes: light and dark. You can pick one of the two themes curing the installation.

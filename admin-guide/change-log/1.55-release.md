# 1.55 Release

## Main Symphony 1.55 release - Agent 2.55.21

### **New Features**

* **Symphony Elements** - released in 1.55.3

Symphony Elements is a collection of [interactive elements](../../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/available-elements/) that can be sent within messages to facilitate the communication with Symphony users. Through interactive content, users can reply to messages in an entertaining and easy way.

Through the use of the elements, bots can send messages that contain forms with text fields, dropdown menus, person selectors, buttons and more! For more information, refer to [Symphony Elements](../../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/).

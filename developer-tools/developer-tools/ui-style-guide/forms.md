# Form Elements

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: For native support of input fields and buttons, refer to [Symphony Elements](../../../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/).  The following is built for extension applications looking to implement their own button or input logic.  
{% endhint %}

Using form element styles will make your apps look native to the users. Things like theming and performance optimization will be applied automatically:

```markup
<input type="text" class="tempo-input-standard" placeholder="Search" />
```

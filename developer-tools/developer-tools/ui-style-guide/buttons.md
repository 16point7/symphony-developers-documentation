# Buttons

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: For native support of Buttons, refer to [Symphony Elements](../../../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/).  The following is built for extension applications looking to implement their own button or input logic.  
{% endhint %}

Buttons change color depending on the userâ€™s theming preferences. They are generally the same color as the theme accent color.

Buttons must include the following class to inherit the proper shape:

* `tempo-btn`

You can modify the style of a button by applying any of these additional classes:

* `tempo-btn--primary`
* `tempo-btn--secondary`
* `tempo-btn--link`
* `tempo-btn--disabled`

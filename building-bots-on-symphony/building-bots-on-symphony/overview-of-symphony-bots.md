# Overview of Symphony Bots

## What is a Symphony Bot?

A Symphony bot can be thought of as an automated version of a human performing specific tasks in Symphony.  Most actions that an end user is able to perform in Symphony can be performed by a bot as well.  

Each bot has a unique identity represented by a service account that has similar features to an end-user account such as a name and avatar.

Symphony Bots enable end users to benefit from innovative **workflows** and timesaving **automations** built on top of the Symphony platform.   

## How do Bots create enhanced workflows and automations?

The answer lies in Symphony's open REST API.  Once authenticated, Symphony Bots can leverage the Symphony REST API that enables bots to execute administrative functions such as creating chatrooms, managing users, and facilitating cross-pod connections.  In addition, Symphony's REST API allows bots to perform messaging functions such as sending and receiving messages and signals.

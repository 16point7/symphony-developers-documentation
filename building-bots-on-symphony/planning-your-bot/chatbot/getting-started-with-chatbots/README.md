# Getting Started With Chatbots

## Build Your First Bot

Symphony provides a number of tools to help streamline Bot development: 

## Symphony SDKs

Symphony SDKs help bootstrap your Bot, providing easy to use authentication handlers, centralized configuration, convenient error handling, as well as baked in best practices.  Additionally, our SDKs provide out of the box Datafeed and event handling architecture that make it simple for your Bot to handle different events.  Lastly, our SDKs provide language-specific API bindings.  Instead of calling the REST endpoint directly, simply call the corresponding SDK functions within your Bot's code.

## Bot Developer Kit

The next tool in Symphony's suite of development tools is the BDK, or Bot Developer Kit.  The Bot Developer Kit comprises three development tools for more advanced Symphony Bot and Extension App development.

#### Bot SDK

The Bot SDK is a Java specific SDK that provides all the basic support as our other SDKs including authentication handlers, centralized configuration, convenient error handling, Datafeed management, and API bindings.  In addition, the Bot SDK provides development best practices for building enterprise grade, financial applications.

# Creating a Bot User

In order to create a bot and begin your development journey, you must first create a Bot user or service account.  You can do this directly or contact your Symphony administrator to assist you if you do not have the proper access.  

## Create a Bot User

1. Navigate to your Symphony admin console for your Pod \(for example, https://mypod.symphony.com/admin-console\) and login with your credentials.

2. Select '**CREATE AN ACCOUNT**' from the left hand navigation.

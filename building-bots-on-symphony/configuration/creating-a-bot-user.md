# Creating a Bot User

In order to create a bot and begin your development journey, you must first create a bot user or service account. You can do this directly in the admin portal or contact your Symphony administrator to assist you if you do not have the proper access.

## Create a Bot User

1. Navigate to your Symphony admin console for your Pod \(for example, [https://mypod.symphony.com/admin-console\](https://mypod.symphony.com/admin-console%29\) and login with your credentials.
2. Select '**CREATE AN ACCOUNT**' from the left hand navigation.
